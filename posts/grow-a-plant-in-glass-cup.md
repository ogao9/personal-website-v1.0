## Background
An easy, low-maintenance way to grow your very own plant all in a glass cup.
An amazing journey watching the roots grow, new leaves come in, and just a pleasant presence for your room. 
Talk about "propagation" for 2 sentences max.

## First Steps
The first thing we have to do is find a "mother plant." Any green, leafy plant should work. 
The key is that you have to find a plant with nodes. \

Next, take a pair of scissors and steal an arm of the mother plant. Make sure this arm has at least one node on it. 
This node will be the place where your new plant's roots will sprout. \

## Enter the Glass Cup
Place your cutting in a glass cup with some tap water filled 3/4 of the way full, making sure the node is submerged in water.
After that, your work is done! Simply wait and watch the roots grow.

## Last Notes
If you don't want your plant to grow any taller or grow more leaves, just leave your set up as is. 
If you want more leaf growth, I would recommend replacing the water with soil. That's it!
